//  Imagine you are developing a software package that requires users to enter their own
//  passwords. Your software requires that the users' passwords meet the following criteria:
//
//      * The password should be at least six characters long.
//      * The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
//      * The password should have at least one digit.
//
//  Write a program that asks for a password then verifies that it meets the stated criteria.
//  If it doesn't, the program should display a message telling the user why.
